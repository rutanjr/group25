Setup
All the territories in the game are assigned to different players by a randomization. Then the players take turns placing the remainder of their starting troops. Every player starts off with 15 troops to place before the game begins. 

Taking a turn
Each turn every player receives new troops to place. The player then starts of his or her turn by placing the troops and the player can place the troops on any territory they own anywhere on the board. The number of troops received is varying depending on a number of variables, see later on in this declaration. 
After placing the new troops the player can move troops, which means reinforce and/or attack an enemy territory. Itâ€™s only possible to move troops to adjacent territories. If the troops reinforce a territory the troops may not be moved further. If the troops attack they may attack another territory after they successfully attack the territory they are currently located at. However they may not reinforce other territories after they have made an attack. 

The attack
The attacks result is determined by the number of attacking troops together with roll of the dice. The attacker may roll up to three dice and the defender up to two. The attacker may only roll the amount of dice that they have troops on the territory they are attacking from, except one last troop (that has to stay on the territory to keep it occupied) and the defending player may do the same with up to two dice, but doesn't have the last troop limit. Then the players pick their highest die, compares and the one with the lowest roll loses one troop. Then they do the same until one of the players run out of dice. This is repeated until one of the players wins the battle. Attacking with more troops gives higher win chance, but that also means you have to move more troops to the territory you are attacking. 

Receiving troops
The number of received troops increases with the number of territories the player controls and weather the player controls entire buildings. As a base each player receives troops equal to the number of territories they control divided by three and rounded down to the closest int. However a player receives at least three troops each turn as a base. Additional to these base troops they receive bonus troops for each whole building they control. The buildings grants different amount of troops: (*yet to be determined by the entire group*)
