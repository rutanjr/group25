2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting


Everyone has completed the JavaFX tutorial and the RAD has been updated with the improved Domain model.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 


How should we implement the turn and the different phases?

Troops in a priority queue?

Gitinspector - check our line numbers.


4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 


Phases
Place troops
Attack
Move troops

We discussed implementing the phases as a simple Enum/Integer and Display different GUI elements depending on which phase, and thus we control what the user is allowed to do. This might be something we need to discuss with Christer in order to get an outside opinion.


A player should be allowed to move troops from any one territory the player control to any other territory given that the territories are connected  to each other by territories owned by the player.

Gitinspector 
We decided to check our line numbers at least once a week, so that none can be surprised at the end of the course and to help us delegate work. 

5. Wrap up

Since this is a half week, we decided to have a preliminary meeting after the meeting with our supervisor Thursday 09:45 30/4.
