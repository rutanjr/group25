3. Discussion items (35 min) 

  - Some ideas:
	Tower Defense
	Boardgames : Settlers Of Catan, Risk
  - Tower Defense could be implemented, but maybe not as well as we should like
	or have time to do.
  - A boardgame seems alot more fun to implement as there would not be as much focus
	on things like graphics. Instead we can focus more on gamelogic. Risk seems like
	a good choice for a game.
